Multithreaded-web-server
========================
1.	Just type make to compile the code.
2.	Then type ./myhttpd [-options] to run the server.
3.	Connect using telnet or similar client.
4.	Type in the command e.g. GET <file name> 
5.	Please press Enter key twice because, as per HTTP protocol the server expects a blank line after which it will be accepted by the server as a valid request. If enter key is pressed only once the server will not respond.
